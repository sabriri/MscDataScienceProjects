The credits from the film listed four Directors of Photography (in the following order), Mr. Persin, Mr. Wottitz, Pierre Levent and Mr. Bourgoin.  The program for the Awards ceremony and even the official letter from Price Waterhouse with the results of the final voting for the awards listed the three names as winners in this category.  At some point, the name of Henri Persin was dropped from the nomination, as his name has been ""whited-out"" from the official wording for the nomination certificates, and the nominations and winners lists the Academy publishes do not include his name.   The Academy's records and files give no reason for this exclusion.]"
